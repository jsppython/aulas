The biceps is a muscle on the front part of the upper arm.
The biceps is attached to the arm bones by tough connective tissues called tendons.
Rectus femoris occupies the middle of the thigh, covering most of the other three quadriceps muscles.
All four parts of the quadriceps muscle ultimately insert into the tuberosity of the tibia via the patella, where the quadriceps tendon becomes the patellar ligament.
There is a fifth muscle of the quadriceps complex that is often forgotten and rarely taught called articularis genus.
The triceps is an extensor muscle of the elbow joint and an antagonist of the biceps and brachialis muscles.
The triceps is an extensor muscle of the elbow joint and an antagonist of the biceps and brachialis muscles.
The triceps can be worked through either isolation or compound elbow extension movements and can contract statically to keep the arm straightened against resistance.
Isolation movements include cable push-downs, lying triceps extensions and arm extensions behind the back.
Ruptures of the triceps muscle are rare, and typically only occur in anabolic steroid users.
